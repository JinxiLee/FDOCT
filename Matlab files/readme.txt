 	convertProcSpec.bat 	
  
	readlambdadata.m 
  
	readpixeldata.m 	 
  
	xml2mat.m

These files were used to do preliminary prototyping with the Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer. 

convertProcSpec.bat extracts the xml data from the ProcSpec files saved by the spectrometer, batch processing a folder at a time.

The m files read the data into Matlab.
