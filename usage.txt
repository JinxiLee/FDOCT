Usage:

* BscanFFT.bin (or BscanFFT.exe on Windows)
*
* Captures (background) spectrum on receipt of b key
* Captures pi shifted or J0 frame on receipt of p key
* Saves frames on receipt of s key
* Saves J0 null frame for subtraction on receipt of j key
* Clears the J0 thresholding mask on c key
*
* Do manual frame by frame averaging with ini file option
*
* Save individual frames on averaging if option chosen in ini file
*
* + (or =) key increases exposure time by 0.1 ms
* - (or _) key decreases exposure time by 0.1 ms
* u key increases exposure time by 1 ms
* d key decreases exposure time by 1 ms
* U key increases exposure time by 10 ms
* D key decreases exposure time by 10 ms
* A key toggles averaging
* Q key toggles clamping upper bound of displayed Bscan to 50 dB
* ] key increases thresholding in final Bscan
* [ key decreases thresholding in final Bscan
* 9 or ( key decreases the index of the reported ascan max value
* 0 or ) key increases the index of the reported ascan max value 
* 
* w decreases width of ROI for which avg val is reported, W increases width
* h decreases the height (position), H increases
* location of ROI is to the right of the index of reported ascan
* e toggles rEporting/plotting of ROI average intensity
* 
* ESC, x or X key quits
